Muir Woods National Monument
Trail Map

Introduction: This map shows the Muir Woods National Monument in California.
I went on a trip to San Francisco with my mom in 2019. We took a ferry from San Francisco to Sausalito and then took a bus to get to Muir Woods. The trails we hiked together are marked by a dashed blue line and the stops we made are marked by points on the map. We hiked from the visitor center on the Redwoods Trail to the Alice Eastwood Group Campsite then to the Coastal View Trail.

Functions: I used functions to change the style for the line, points, and interactive points to show the name. 

Libraries: I used two CSS libraries for the browser title, font, and style of the description box. I used two google font libraries for the body and headers. I used two javascript libraries for the interactive map.

Data Sources: The text for the description box is provided by the National Park Service. The map line and points I got from Google Maps and converted it to a GeoJson file using geojson.io. I got the basemap from leaflet provider
